1. How do you specify units in the CSS?. What are the different ways to do it?

-There are different ways to specify units in CSS like px, em, pt, percentage (%)

1- px
Definition: Pixels are a fixed unit of measurement in CSS, representing a single dot on the screen. It is an absolute unit, meaning the size does not change based on the parent or other elements.

2-em
Definition: The em unit is relative to the font size of the element it's applied to. If you set font-size to 2em, it will be twice the size of the current font.

3- pt (Points)
 Definition: Points are a traditional print unit, where 1pt equals 1/72 of an inch. This is mostly used for print media and not recommended for web design.

 4-
  % (Percentage)

    Definition: Percentages are relative to the parent element's size. For example, if you set width: 50%, it will be 50% of the width of the parent element.
